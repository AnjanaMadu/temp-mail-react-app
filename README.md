# ðŸ’Œ Temp Mail App

This is a simple web app that allows you to generate temporary email addresses. It is built using [React](https://reactjs.org/), [ExpressJS](https://expressjs.com/), and [temp-mail.io API](https://temp-mail.io/).

# How to build and start ðŸš€

To get started with the Temp Mail App, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:

    git clone https://github.com/AnjanaMadu/temp-mail-react-app --depth 1
    ```
    
2. Change to the project directory:

4. Build the project:
